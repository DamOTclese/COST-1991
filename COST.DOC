Description:
   This program will accept a phone number for examination and look it up to
   see if it is a free call, a cheep zone call, or simply long distance. The
   operator must supply this information, of course, by creating a file called
   LOCAL.DAT, (a sample LOCAL.DAT is provided).

Running it:

   Type:   COST XXX-XXX-XXXX

   This will cause the program to search through its Local.Dat file for the
   number and offer a report on it.

   Type:   COST <filename>

   This will cause the program to search through <filename> nodelist for any
   free nodes or nodes that are accessable as cheap zones. The operator is
   offered the choice of having the output placed into a file or on the screen.

Where to find cost information:

   Located at the first pages of your White Pages, find an index into "Local
   and ZUM Calling", (note that your phone company may index somewhat
   differently than General Telephone). Search for "Local calling area from"
   and find your city or town in the listings. The information provided tells
   you what it free in the various area codes, and what diferent zones are cut
   rate. Discount information on the zones for after-hours is also given.

How to enter the information:

   Produce a hard copy of LOCAL.DAT and get rid of it if you're certain you
   have the archive copy: COST.ARC. You can use this information as a
   guide-line.

   Information contained within the file is mostly free-form except where
   indicated. This means that any leading or trailing spaces on a line are
   ignored. In addition, if you place more than one space between parameters,
   only one space will be used to delimit the parameters internally. Tabs are
   valid and will produce no errors. No verification of syntax takes place on
   much of the information in this file.

First:

   First enter the area codes which are directly dialable and are callable at
   no charge. Then list the telephone exchanges which are accessable under the
   area code:

   Area XXX
      YYY YYY YYY YYY YYY
      YYY YYY YYY YYY YYY

   You may have only one area code on the "Area" line as a parameter and any
   number of spaces may be placed between Area and XXX.

   There may be any number of exchanges, (YYY), on a line, and any number of
   lines under Area XXX. Any 3 digit number which follows Area will be treated
   as an exchange. There may be any number of spaces between exchanges.

   If there is another area code which is directly dialable at no charge,
   simply start another Area XXX and list the exchanges, (YYY).

Second:

   List the Zones and Area codes of the cheap calls. Then list the exchanges
   that are under that zone and area code. This looks something like this:

   Zone X YYY
      ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ
      ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ
      ZZZ

   The X is the zone number as offered in the white pages. The YYY is the area
   code for that zone where the exchanges are cheap calls, (ZZZ). Note that
   any number of spaces may be between Zone, X, YYY, and/or ZZZ. Any number of
   exchanges may be placed on a line and there may be any number of lines.

   If there is another zone, simply add it.

Third:

   Now tell the computer what the cost of the zones are. This information is
   offered in this format:

   Cost Zone X YYY And ZZZ

   This tells the computer that zone X has a cost of YYY for the first minute
   and ZZZ for any minute after that. You MUST supply the keywords COST ZONE
   and AND. Be sure to provide decimal points as though it were a dollar value.

   If you have additional zones, provide ccost information simply by creating
   more Cost Zone lines.

Fourth:

   The last thing to do is to tell the computer what the times and amounts of
   the discounts, (if any), are available from your area. This information is
   provided in the following format:

   From XX To YY ZZZ%

   Here, XX represents the starting hour of this particular discount or pay
   rate while YY represents the ending hour. These two values MUST be 24 hour
   times. The ZZZ% represents the discount. If full charges apply during this
   time period, this value should be 100%. It is  very important to provide
   the keyword "To".

   If there are more time frames, simply list them in the same formmat as
   offered above.

Problems:

   There won't be any but if there are, problems are usually created by
   invalid formatting or the omission of some information. Check for tabs and
   other control characters before you start debugging.
